# Area 19 sampling proposal

## Context

Following the 2023 stock assessment in January of 2024, an infomal proposal was put forward to add survey stations to CFA 19.

### Fishery perception
Crab Fishing Area (CFA) 19, on the western coast of Cape Breton, has seen significant declines in commercial biomass estimates from the 2022 and 2023 snow crab surveys. Despite this, commercial CPUEs remained at historical highs, generally between two to three times the levels seen in other areas. For example in 2023, seasonal CPUEs in CFA 12 were 72 kg per trap, considered a banner year, while they were an impressive 140 kg per trap CFA 19. Oceanographic conditions within CFA 19 are considered more varied and dynamic than CFA 12, due to warmer waters, complex topography and local upwellings. 

Naturally this has raised doubts as to the accuracy of the survey results. The following critiques have been made:
- There are **too few stations** (25 stations) to have a precise estimate. For instance between 1996 and 2005 there were 40-54 stations in the CFA. The number of stations were reduced following framework reviews in 2005 and 2011.
- The **timing of the survey** is skewing biomass estimates. Sampling in CFA 19 is now performed at the very end of the survey, generally in September. Fishery representatives perceive that this is too late in the season, and that seasonal warming of waters may be somehow leading to crab moving out of the surveys visibility. In other words the survey is sampling areas that are **too deep for the time of year**.

### Science perception
- Decreases in commercial biomass were presaged by decreases in fishery pre-recruits in the area in and around CFA 19.
- High CPUEs may be in part due to deep warm water layers effectively corralling crab into locally high concentrations.
- There is no evidence of accumulation of old-shelled crab in the area, which is an indication that fishing/natural mortality is high.
- The area has been generally 1-2 degrees warmer that CFA 12, and there is evidence that bottom waters are warming.
- The current set of 25 fixed stations may be biased with respect to underlying concentrations. Such an effect would be exacerbated if crab were more aggregated than in other areas. Warming temperatures may be contributing to this effect.

## Science questions
- How does the perception of the snow crab stock change at the current set of stations over the survey sampling season?
- If we had a new set of survey stations, how would our stock perception change?
- IF we used a stratified sampling design, e.g. by depth and spatial strata, could we significantly improve the precision?

## Issues and conflicts
- Most of the above issues also apply to CFAs 12E and 12F.
- The 2005 and 2011 framework reviews intentionally redistributed survey stations so that they were more spatially uniform. Adding stations in CFA as part of regular survye acitvities goes against the reviews' recommendations.
