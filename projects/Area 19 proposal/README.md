# Area 19 sampling proposal

## Context

### Fishery perception
Crab Fishing Area 19, on the western coast of Cape Breton, has seen significant declines in commercial biomass estimates from the 2022 and 2023 snow crab surveys. Despite this, commercial CPUEs remained at historical highs, generally between two to three times the levels seen in other areas. For example in 2023, seasonal CPUEs in CFA 12 were 72 kg per trap, 
considered a banner, while they were 140 kg per trap CFA 19.

Naturally this has raised doubts as to the accuracy of the survey results. The following critiques have been made:
- There are **too few stations** (25 stations) to have a precise estimate. For instance between 1996 and 2005 there were 40-54 stations in the area. The number of stations were reduced following framework reviews in 2005 and 2011.
- The **timing of the survey** is skewing biomass estimates. Sampling in CFA 19 is now performed at the very end of the survey, generally in September. Fishery representatives perceive that this is too late in the season, and that seasonal warming of waters may be somehow leading to crab moving out of the surveys visibility. In other words the survey is sampling areas that are **too deep for the time of year**.

### Science perception

- The The topography in CFA 19 is : there are two deep-water troughs which connect with warming waters of the the Laurentian Channel. The area is also subject to local upwellings and temperature swings. As such, snow crab catches are likely dependent on timing and sampling depth.
