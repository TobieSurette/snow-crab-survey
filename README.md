# snow-crab-survey

The southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence snow crab survey follows a stratified random design, in that stations are randomly located within a grid overlaying the survey area. 
Despite the locations being originally random, stations are generally held at fixed locations from year to year. The current incarnation of station locations arose from a 
survey redesign in 2013. Since then, many survey stations have been relocated in response to trawl damage. This practice has the consequence of slow convergence of survey 
stations to more trawlable areas, which could lead to possible catch biases.

For the 2021 survey, the design was modified slightly to test whether these relocations have had an impact with respect to catches. For this purpose, 100 stations from the 
2021 stations were replaced with originals from the 2013 set of random locations.
