# snow-crab-survey

Southern Gulf of Saint Lawrence (sGSL) snow crab is assessed using a dedicated annual trawl survey. The locations of survey stations are randomly chosen within a fixed grid which overlays the survey area. The survey covers most of the snow crab habitat in the sGSL and stations depths lie between 30 and 350 meters.
